# Technical Architecture for the Multi-Chain Platform

## System Design with Components
- **Frontend**: Built using **Next.js** for a responsive and dynamic user interface.
- **API Gateway**: Serves as a single entry point for all client requests, routing them to appropriate services.
- **Chain Connectors**: Interfaces for connecting with different blockchains:
  - **Stellar**
  - **EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)**
  - **Solana**
- **Indexer Service**: Responsible for indexing blockchain data to provide quick access to relevant information.
- **Data Layer**: Utilizes **PostgreSQL** for structured data storage and **Redis** for caching and fast data retrieval.

## Security Model
- **Non-Custodial**: Users maintain control of their private keys.
- **Custodial**: Platform holds users' assets with enhanced security measures.

## Deployment Targets
- **Development**: Environments for testing and iteration.
- **Production**: Live environment for end-users with high availability and reliability.

## Extensibility Patterns
- Strategies for seamlessly integrating new blockchain support without major refactoring.

## Observability Approach
- Implementing tools like **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **Sentry** for monitoring and alerting.

## Dependencies and Tooling
- List of libraries, frameworks, and tools used in the development process.

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: For individual components.
- **Integration Tests**: To ensure components work together as expected.
- **E2E Tests**: Testing the entire flow from frontend to backend.
- **Load Tests**: To assess performance under high traffic conditions.
